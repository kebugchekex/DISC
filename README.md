# DISC
A discord library for C. You can use it with C++, but it doesn't have any nifty objects.

## Status
Very broken and in early stages. I plan on completing this.

## Libraries Needed
You're gonna need openssl.

## Want to test your bot?
This is a guild where you can invite your bots and talk to me about features you want to add or bugs that need to be squashed.
